# TODO: Add Attractive Charts and Diagrams to Streamlit App

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Add a new "Visualizations" header section after the "About Clubs" section in app.py.
- [x] Implement Bar Chart of Cluster Sizes: Create a bar plot showing number of students per club, with club nicknames on x-axis, counts on y-axis, and distinct colors for each bar.
- [x] Implement Pie Chart of Cluster Distribution: Create a pie chart showing percentage distribution of each cluster, with labels and legend using club nicknames.
- [x] Implement PCA Scatter Plot: Reduce encoded data to 2D using PCA, plot scatter plot colored by cluster, include legend and axis labels.
- [x] Implement Bar Charts for Top Hobbies per Cluster: For each cluster, create a bar chart of top 5 most common hobbies (from 'Hobby_top1' and 'Hobby top2'), with hobby names on x-axis and frequencies on y-axis. Display one chart per cluster in sub-sections.
- [x] Style all plots attractively: Add titles, labels, gridlines, and use a color palette (e.g., from matplotlib's cm).
- [x] Run the app with `streamlit run app.py` to test the visualizations and verify they render correctly.
